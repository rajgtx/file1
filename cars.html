<p>The Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRZ are 2+2 sports cars jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru, manufactured at Subaru's Gunma assembly plant.</p>
  <p>
The 2+2 fastback coupé is noted for its naturally-aspirated boxer engine, front-engined,
rear-wheel-drive configuration, 53/47 front/rear weight balance and low centre of gravity — and for drawing inspiration from Toyota's earlier AE86, a small, light, front-engine/rear-drive Corolla variant widely popular for Showroom Stock, Group A, Group N, Rally, Club and drift racing.</p>
<p>  
For the first-generation model, Toyota marketed the sports car as the 86 in Asia, Australia, 
North America (from August 2016), South Africa, and South America;
as the Toyota GT86 in Europe; as the 86 and GT86 in New Zealand; as the Toyota FT86 in Brunei, 
Nicaragua and Jamaica and as the Scion FR-S (2012–2016) in the United States and Canada.<p>
